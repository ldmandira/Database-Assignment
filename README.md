# Database-Assignment

We are planning to implement a database application to library. This system is monitoring and controlling the transaction in a library. It helps to provide information on any book in library and borrowers details. When the author’s name is entered, details about the books in this library written by the author can be obtained. This feature is another help that the book users can get. It’s a well-organized database solution for a library .

In this project my contribution is to create sql server insert statement & sql trigger statement.
